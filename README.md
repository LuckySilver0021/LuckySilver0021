### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/> 

I’m **Sharan**, a software developer and fianl year graduate student from India. I like writing full stack applications, I also sometimes contribute to Open Source.

**Some stuff I built:**
- [Ask Me Anything](https://github.com/LuckySilver0021/Ask-Me-Anything) -  A Q&A platform to ask questions or give feedback anonymously.
- [Droply](https://github.com/LuckySilver0021/droply) -  A dropbox inspired application built on first engineering principles.
